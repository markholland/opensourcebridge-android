It’s one of the leading reasons why users of open source software don’t become developers of open source software, and why many developers of open source software don’t step out of their comfort zone to try new things. (Plus, it makes you feel awful.)\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll address impostor syndrome from both a personal viewpoint -- how you can help combat those feelings in yourself -- and an affirmational viewpoint -- how you can help others overcome their own impostor syndrome. We’ll also discuss ways open source contributors and projects can specifically fight impostor syndrome among their community contributors (and among people who would be contributors if they believed they were qualified enough to be). You’ll leave with a whole host of tips, tricks, and \"mind hacks\" to help get over the nagging fear somebody’s going to discover any minute that you’re a great big fraud.",

      "description": "SQL is an ISO standard, so you should just be able to switch backend databases, right? Sadly, while standards help, real life applications almost always use version specific syntax and functions. Five years into the development of our application, we started thinking that a different database backend would better meet our future needs. This is the story of why we choose Postgres and Open Source, how and why we switched, what worked, what didn't, what was easy and what was hard. The conversion of our user generated data from a mixture of unknown and unrecorded character sets to consistent UTF-8 added some interesting twists to our journey.\r\n\r\nWhile each application is different, Julie will give you the information you need to decide whether switching backends is right for your project and some tools to get you started. Although we switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL, most of the information applies to any SQL database. This talk will also be useful to people who have been thinking about switching backends for future projects or working on a project with an unfamiliar SQL dialect.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, the application in question provide the CATME SMARTER Teamwork tools (http://www.catme.org) A demo is available at https://www.catme.org/login/survey_instructions",

      "description": "Good study design is like test driven development. In TDD you write the tests before development. In study design you clarify and define the problem or question you want answered before you start collecting data. Pilot studies are performed to see if your idea is workable, or if you need to make adjustments, just like we test code to see if it breaks on Y2K. \r\n\r\nData is everywhere and easily collected. This talk will cover the fundamental statistical principles that allow you answer questions and make predictions.  We’ll talk about barriers to effective experimentation, like poorly defined logic. (I was once asked to study a medical  problem where the definition was “I know it when I see it.\") We’ll also look at some basic R code for frequencies, distributions and histograms to help you analyze your data once you’ve collected it.\r\n\r\nHere’s why this is important to me. At times I have given up and pulled my hair out over bad, insufficient study designs. Good planning up front would saved my clients so much money. I have done many research studies. I had to defend studies when the conclusions conflict with conventional wisdom. Solid study design has backed me up, and it will do the same for you.\r\n",

Companies, communities and conferences cannot expect everything to magically change until they're willing to go deep and examine the systemic patterns and structures that keep underrepresented communities from feeling safe and welcome in the tech space. \r\n\r\nWhen confronting racism results in a critique of the manner in which the offender was confronted by the people calling themselves supporters, it makes it that much harder to address the real issues.\r\n\r\nIf a man's first response to a woman complaining about a sexist incident or a sexual assault is to defend all the men who 'aren't like that,' that shows a lack of empathy. It keeps the focus on how men are being perceived, not empathizing with a woman who has been hurt.  \r\n\r\nThis talk is for people in positions of all sorts of privilege who consider themselves allies to underrepresented minorities and want to learn how to be more effective allies.\r\n\r\nWe'll talk about what it's like to live as a minority--why someone might have what seems to you like an 'overreaction' to something that seems small.\r\n\r\nHow to stop, drop, and empathize before you go on the personal defensive for anger that's directed at a group that you happen to be a part of, even if you didn't specifically do anything wrong.\r\n\r\nWe'll talk about tone policing, derailing, man-splaining and other hurtful behaviors that are sometimes practiced by well meaning people who consider themselves allies. \r\n\r\nLeave your ego at the door and come with an open heart. \r\n\r\nSlides for this presentation can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/kronda/expanding-your-empathy\r\n\r\n<script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-event_id=\"9a8774b0bc01013049c27272943a3f76\" data-ratio=\"1.2994923857868\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>",

      "description": "Lots of programmers whip up small- to medium-sized scripts in Bash (or pure sh), but I write full-blown programs in Bash, complete with libs, docs, and test suites.  If you didn't look at the source, you'd never know it was Bash and not Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, or any other language.\r\n\r\nWhy do such a thing? There's actually a strong argument for using Bash for programs that make extensive use of standard system commands.  An amazing amount can be done with awk, sed, sort, read, pipes, subshells, etc.  I'll show you how.\r\n\r\nNo program is \"professional grade\" unless it's modular and tested.  You can do this with Bash, too.  Bash has some awareness of libraries, but none of testing.  That's ok: I'll show you how both can be done easily and sanely.\r\n\r\nIf you're a professional developer that spends most of the time in a Unix/Linux shell--sysadmins, DBAs, etc.--then join this talk to learn how the Bash shell you're probably already using can also be a very powerful programming language.",

Null pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks all occur in C and C++-based applications in the wild, and can all cause serious security vulnerabilities. C and C++ compilers and tools are at best only partially able to detect these problems during development. While memory-safe languages such as Haskell and Scala solve these problems, historically, systems programmers have not found these languages acceptable for meeting their performance goals. Rust, a new open-source language being stewarded by Mozilla, aims to make memory safety bugs a thing of the past without sacrificing performance. Rust supports large-scale programming and its needs for reliability, efficient use of space and time, and concurrency.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial talk, I will show you how to write fast code in Rust with the help of a compiler that detects many potential bugs at compile time. I will start by showing you how to write simple prototypes in a subset of Rust that uses garbage collection. Then, I will refine these examples to use Rust's \"borrowed pointers\". Using borrowed pointers eliminates the overhead of garbage collection because the compiler can determine these pointers' lifetimes at compile time. I will show you how to manage memory in Rust in ways that are just as efficient as they would be in a C++ program but enjoy stronger compile-time correctness checking than C++ compilers provide. As I'll explain, this style of coding requires more thought during development because you have to be explicit about the relationships between data structures in memory, but it pays off in the long term by eliminating dangling pointers and memory leaks, without incurring unwanted memory management overhead.\r\n\r\nAll the examples I'll show will be based on real applications, potentially drawn from an audio decoder, an NES game emulator, and a prototype Web browser engine (Servo - https://github.com/mozilla/servo - under development at Mozilla). All examples will be adapted from open-source programs that are freely available on Github.

Between these and other affiliated events including Railsbridge Boston and the Chicago Python Workshop, our community has learned a lot about how to create events with effective mentorship.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will work together through lecture and hands-on exercises.\r\n\r\nFirst, we discuss together the motivation behind newcomer-oriented events in the first place, with concrete examples from OpenHatch-affiliated events.\r\n\r\n* Setting outreach goals\r\n* Making them measurable\r\n* Finding existing communities to work with (including the story of the Boston Python Workshop)\r\n\r\nWe discuss how Open Source Comes to Campus' approach to mentorship has changed over the >2 years the program has been running.\r\n\r\nWe then demonstrate a handful of ways, with varying effectiveness, of identifying students at a newcomer-oriented workshop that may not be getting the most out of the workshop. You'll see how to identify those that need help, and even practice interrupting a demonstration attendee to get them the help they are not yet asking for!\r\n\r\nWe will provide you a tour of a sample laptop setup guide, explain we write ours the way we do, and demonstrate what kinds of problems students typically face.\r\n\r\nFinally, attendees train using the mentor guide for Open Source Comes to Campus. This enables them to, after the conference, run these events in their home cities.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it enables them to reflect on the OpenHatch model. Open Source Comes to Campus is used here as an example, we open up the floor to active creation where attendees discuss with each other (and event organizers) how to apply these principles to their own efforts.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the event leads to a thousand outreach events blooming, and that those events choose to become affiliated with OpenHatch! <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Events/Affiliated>\r\n\r\n(Also: co-presenters welcome!

He recalled University of Chicago Law School dean Gerhard Casper's comment that he was proud that there was no class entitled \"Law of the Horse,\" because such a course would be \"doomed to be shallow and to miss unifying principles.\" \r\n\r\nLawrence Lessig and others disagreed, suggesting that cyberspace was an entirely new thing, that required new regulatory models.

We know from research, however, that most people can’t edit, and so we, a team from the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikia, are building a visual editor to bridge the gap. This is particularly challenging because MediaWiki's syntax, wikitext, is a superset of HTML and Wikipedia’s content is so complex.\r\n\r\nIn the two years that we have been working on this project, we have encountered some unique challenges posed by creating an editor for wikitext and deploying it to an enormous corpus of existing articles have led us to push the limits of Web browsers, JavaScript, parsers and our own creativity.\r\n\r\nAt OS Bridge 2013, we will be a few days away from having VisualEditor be the default way people edit all Wikipedias in all languages. It has come a long way since the demonstration version we showed at OS Bridge 2012. It provides a simple way to create and edit articles, from tiny stubs to mature and complex articles, while still allowing experienced editors to use the old wikitext editor if they want to.

      "speaker_ids": [1284], "event_id": 984,  "track_id": 28,      "description": "=Introduction=\r\n\r\nOpen source projects live off the fact that developers turn into contributors and invest their precious time into creating patches, bug fixes and or enhanced functionality for an Open Source code base.\r\n\r\nAs a maintainer of an Open Source project there's significant effort involved in correctly handling these contributions. Reviewing patches from contributors, ensuring the patches completeness (coding style issues and test coverage) are equally as important as running the patched code against the test suite before it’s acceptance. Nobody wants to destabilize the usability of the code base or jeopardize the projects success or momentum, right?!\r\n\r\n=Let The Internet Work For You!=\r\n\r\nWe all love Github for their free code hosting and streamlined collaboration experience. Let's introduce two more players to the table to complete the stack:\r\n\r\nTravis, the Continuous Integration Service\r\nSauce Labs, Selenium Cloud Service\r\n\r\nGithub hosts a lot of the Open Source code which is crucial to the productivity of a Web Developer, however there is a lot more than hosting needed (test execution, static analysis, linting etc) to ensure the hosted code's quality. Travis CI is our friend. The guys at Travis provide a continuous integration service for the open source community free of charge to handle exactly this. In addition to the awesome integration with Github,  it'll check out the latest code and let us perform any given task we can think of, eg. kicking off a test runner for our unit tests or performing static analysis across the code base.\r\n\r\nTo keep up with outside contributions to one’s open source project -- it’s quite helpful to have a continuous build not just for the stable trunk of the project but also for contributing pull requests. Travis and Github came up with a nice solution to this problem -- they kick off builds in Travis-CI whenever a pull request was created and will make information about the build status available through the pull request management user interface.\r\n\r\nSauce Labs has a free service offering for Open Source developers, too. We’ll be using their Selenium Cloud to run QUnit Javascript browser test suites against various browser and platform combinations.\r\n\r\n=Let’s Connect The Dots=\r\n\r\nWe’ll be using a Github hosted example project to illustrate end-to-end integrated test execution. In order to make all these free services work together we’ll need to write a thin layer of code to glue them all together. Enter node.js and grunt.js: Grunt.js is to node.js what GNU Make is to GCC. It’ll let you perform repetitive tasks in an elegant way, using a set of common and or hand-crafted build tasks.\r\n\r\nI’ll show how we can leverage grunt.js tasks to make Travis-CI connect to Sauce Labs through an encrypted secure tunnel, launch a web server to serve the web pages that contain QUnit test suites and execute the javascript tests against a number of platform/browser combinations. Of course all the status information will be conveniently communicated across all the services.\r\n\r\nEver since javascript browser test execution has become such a common use case the sequence of steps required to accomplish aforementioned steps have already been implemented as a grunt.js task. I’ll show how to leverage this for any Github hosted project. \r\n\r\n=How Does This Benefit Me As A Maintainer?=\r\n\r\nI’ll show how Github, Travis-CI and Sauce Labs, can integrate build success / failure reporting into the collaboration workflow on Github to notify maintainers ahead of time about problems which may have gotten introduced with a code contribution.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this end-to-end test integration is that it will not only run whenever new code was committed, but also branches that have been submitted for merge to master through a pull request. No need for the project maintainer to check out code to their local machines and run tests repeatedly. By the time maintainers review pull requests they will already able to see whether the branch submitted for merge, met style and syntax, and if there were any problems running the javascript browser test suite.

I want to share with you some lessons I've learned from 25 years of participation in perhaps the longest-running end-user-facing Open Source project. With the desktop apparently in decline, it seems like a good time to discuss lessons in open source architecture, governance, evolution and dissemination that can be drawn from X.\r\n\r\nMy talk will begin with a brief history of X. This will be used as a basis for discussing topics including: a model for initiating a large open source project;  the several styles of X governance--what worked and what did not; planning for and executing large step changes in the open source model; getting open source out there.",  "start_time": "2013-06-20T16:45:00-07:00",   "presenter": null}, {"room_title": "B302/303",

Not only do you need to find volunteers, but once you have them, you need to foster, encourage, and motivate them to accomplish not only their goals, but your organization's goals as well. This is difficult to do, but not as impossible as it may sound.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to understand that not every person interested in helping with your project will actually know what they're doing. Most non-profit organizations understand that there's some amount of mentoring required to get even the most talented volunteer ready to actually help. This a step that OSS projects often forget, and it is why recruiting and retaining dedicated volunteers can be so difficult.\r\n\r\nI will discuss ways to create an environment that encourages volunteer participation, direction, and retention, using a variety of methods garnered from my experiences in both OSS and non-profit organizations.",  "start_time": "2013-06-20T16:45:00-07:00",   "presenter": null}, {"room_title": null,

Your hips get tight, and your core gets soft. In this session, you will practice some simple stretching and strengthening movements to rebalance your body (so you can hack longer).\r\n\r\nBreathing and hydrating are required for your life to continue. You'll get more out of both if you take these actions consciously and deliberately. You will learn a simple breathing exercise with some stretching built in. Have a drink of water first, though.\r\n\r\nAre there stairs where you work? Go up the stairs at least once each day. Is there a railing? You can do reverse rows on almost any bar. The same creativity and problem-solving skills you use in your work can be applied to your health. We will discuss some things to look for, and ways to engage your co-workers.
