Within a year, she had been recruited to the conference planning team, which she now leads. She was involved in setting up the Community Development project at Apache, has previously acted as Org Admin for the Google Summer of Code (with more than 40 students!), and continues to contribute to projects as diverse as Infrastructure and Incubator. She sits on the boards of both the Apache Software Foundation and the Open Cloud Initiative.\r\n\r\nAt home in Ireland, Noirin was a volunteer with the St John Ambulance - since moving to Switzerland, she's had to find new ways to help save the world. Happily, open source has opened more than just technical doors, and when Christchurch suffered a devastating earthquake earlier this year, Noirin's knowledge of OS disaster management software meant she could quickly step up to co-ordinate the night shift of volunteers working on the Christchurch Recovery Map at \"http://eq.org.nz/\":http://eq.org.nz/ .\r\n\r\nWhen she's not online, Noirin's natural habitat is the dance floor, although she's also a keen harpist & singer, and an excellent sous chef!"
